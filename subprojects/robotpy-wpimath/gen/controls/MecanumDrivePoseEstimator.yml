      This class wraps an Unscented Kalman Filter to fuse latency-compensated
      vision measurements with mecanum drive encoder velocity measurements. It will
      correct for noisy measurements and encoder drift. It is intended to be an
      easy but more accurate drop-in for :class:`MecanumDriveOdometry`.

      :meth:`update` should be called every robot loop. If your loops are faster or
      slower than the default of 0.02s, then you should change the nominal delta
      time by specifying it in the constructor.

      :meth:`addVisionMeasurement` can be called as infrequently as you want; if you
      never call it, then this class will behave mostly like regular encoder
      odometry.

      Our state-space system is:

      :math:`x = [[x, y, theta]]^T` in the
      field-coordinate system.

      :math:`u = [[vx, vy, omega]]^T` in the field-coordinate system.

      :math:`y = [[x, y, theta]]^T` in field
      coords from vision, or :math:`y = [[theta]]^T`
      from the gyro.
